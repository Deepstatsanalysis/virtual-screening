Virtual Screening Guide
=======================
## Download your dataset from the ZINC15 database in the directory labelled 'downloads'.
## A sample script that downloads a large dataset can be found in this directory.
## Run the 'dataset_prep.sh' script to clean and process the files for Autodock Vina.
 * cd downloads
 * ./dataset_prep.sh
 
## Create a text file containing the list of files that will be used for the virtual screening.
 * \ls -afq ./dataset > dataset.txt

## Run Virtual Screening.
 * ./run_screening.sh dataset.txt 320
 * (NOTE: "320" indicates the number of cores to use and can be adjusted based on your CPU specs.)

## Optional: Post-process the results, and visualize the results from the 'analysis' directory.
 * cd analysis
 * python screen_results.py 100 > top_100_scores.txt
 * (NOTE: "100" is an adjustable variable. If "100" is used, you'll get a list of top 100 compounds from the screening.)
 * pymol `awk '{print $3}' top_100_scores.txt` ../vina_files/receptor.pdb
